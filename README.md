# Bayesian_spectral_clustering

In the main folder you can find the benchmark datasets that we used. The first thing it to run the file "AGitHub_Benchmarks.R" to load the data.
Then, you can choose one of the four models to perform bayesian spectral clustering.

In every case, the model is run by the file "AMain"+ model number +".R", even if the fourth model needs to run a file for "AData_preprocessing.R" before.

Note that only the last model is able to do satifying results on all the ensembles, the others can only work for the first two.
